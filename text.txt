I have listed my work history below as proof of how much experience I have from various kinds of work down the years. From an early age I have been driven to work as much as possible. I believe it has aided me on getting useful experience and skills, as well as the right kind of attitude and the financial position for better life in general.


I mainly completed my basic education (comprehensive school) in Muurame, which ended in June 2015.

I attended secondary education (upper secondary school) at Schildt High School in Jyv채skyl채. I graduated in December 2018. The subjects I passed in the matriculation examination were history, social studies, English, Finnish language, and mathematics.

In August 2020, I started my studies at <a href="https://www.jamk.fi/en" class="text-info">Jyv채skyl채 University of Applied Sciences (JAMK).</a>
                    My goal is to graduate as a Bachelor of Engineering in Information and Communications Technology in 2024.

The first few years at JAMK were focused on fundamental IT courses.

My third year has focused on optional specialized studies in web/mobile applications, as well as professional visual content production in digital media format.

For the fall of 4th year, I took the project of studying the Full Stack-open course provided by the University of Helsinki, in order to deepen my knowledge in application development as a whole.

In the spring of 2024 I completed my <a

                    class="text-info"
                    >thesis</a> project. The focus of the research
                    was on usability through developing a mobile application with React Native framework.
                    I designed and developed the application myself and used GraphQL query language
                    for the server. Data storage was done through MongoDB.
